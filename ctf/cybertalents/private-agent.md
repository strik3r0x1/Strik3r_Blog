You should always think about any challenge or a lab name. Sometime it\`s a lead or a hint for solution.

So it is obvious that the challenge related somehow by User Agent

### <mark style="color:yellow;">**What is User Agent?**</mark>

The **User-Agent** request header is a characteristic string that lets servers and network peers identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent.

You can know more about User Agent from [Mozilla Developers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User\_agent)

I used to go through very basic recon steps when playing CyberTalents Challenges.

Also this Challenge rating is easy, so you must start from basics things.

* Open source code and notice anything interesting

You will notice that there is nothing in this section of the page.

But wait, just scroll a bit for bottom of the page.

You will find this comment **`<!-- TO_Be_RemovedTO_Be_Removed => Privet-Agent access => givittome -->`**

So without any other thinking inject this value `givittome` in **user-agent** header in burpsuit
